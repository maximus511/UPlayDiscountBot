# Uplay Discount Bot
Bot program to capture the text from a video playing on the screen

- This can be easily modified to capture directly from a livestream but due to network latency, we could miss a large chunk of video frames between captures.
- To avoid the latency issues, this program requires the video to be played actively while it captures the frame from the screen itself.
- The project uses Google Cloud vision library and so will require the same to be set up before it can run.

This was designed in fun for the purpose of capturing game codes displayed on the screen during the initial Ubisoft Forward event and entering these captured codes into the UPlay application to complete the transaction.

P.S - *This will not work any more as UPlay application is no longer active (has been replaced by Ubisoft Connect ever since).*
